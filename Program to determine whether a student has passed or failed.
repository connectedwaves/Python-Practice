# Program to determine whether a student has passed or failed.
# Passing criteria: Total percentage >= 40% and at least 33% in each subject.

# Input marks for three subjects
marks1 = int(input("Enter Marks 1: "))
marks2 = int(input("Enter Marks 2: "))
marks3 = int(input("Enter Marks 3: "))

# Calculate total percentage
total_marks = marks1 + marks2 + marks3
total_percentage = (total_marks / 300) * 100

# Check pass/fail conditions
if total_percentage >= 40 and marks1 >= 33 and marks2 >= 33 and marks3 >= 33:
    print(f"You have passed! Your total percentage is {total_percentage:.2f}%.")
else:
    print(f"Unfortunately, you have failed. Better luck next time. Your total percentage is: {total_percentage:.2f}%.")
